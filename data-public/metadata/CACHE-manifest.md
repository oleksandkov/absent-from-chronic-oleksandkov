## Overview

| Dataset | Path | Format | Rows (default mode) | Columns |
|---------|------|--------|--------------------:|---------|
| `cchs_analytical` | `data-private/derived/cchs-2-tables/cchs_analytical.parquet` | Parquet | 63,843 | 62 |
| `cchs_analytical` | `data-private/derived/cchs-2.sqlite` | SQLite | 63,843 | 62 |
| `sample_flow` | `data-private/derived/cchs-2-tables/sample_flow.parquet` | Parquet | 5 | 5 |
| `sample_flow` | `data-private/derived/cchs-2.sqlite` | SQLite | 5 | 5 |

**Run mode:** `apply_sample_exclusions = TRUE` (§3.1 exclusion criteria applied).
Full pooled mode (`apply_sample_exclusions = FALSE`) yields ~126,431 rows.

**Source cycles pooled:**

| Cycle | CCHS label | Raw rows | After exclusions |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| `cycle = 0` | CCHS 2010–2011 | ~62,909 | 32,621 |
| `cycle = 1` | CCHS 2013–2014 | ~63,522 | 31,222 |

**Survey weight pooling (Statistics Canada guideline):**

```
wts_m_pooled   = wts_m / 2      # for each respondent
bsw001_pooled  = bsw001 / 2     # same rule applied to all 500 bootstrap weights
```

`wts_m_original` is retained alongside `wts_m_pooled` for verification.

## Reference Diagnostics (`cchs_analytical`, default mode)

Verified from actual run on 2026-05-15. Four INFERRED white-list variables are absent from both
CCHS PUMF cycles (`ccc_300`, `ccc_185`, `dhhdfc12p`, `sdcdgstud`); two of these (`sdcdgstud`,
`dhhdfc12p`) are added as NA columns for factor recode compatibility; two CCC conditions
(`ccc_300`, `ccc_185`) are entirely absent from the dataset.
Bootstrap weights (`bsw*`) were also absent. Diagnostics reflect the current data files.

| Diagnostic | Actual value |
|------------|-------------|
| Unweighted sample size | 63,843 |
| Weighted mean `days_absent_total` | ≈ 1.25 |
| Weighted variance `days_absent_total` | ≈ 15.4 |
| Dispersion (variance / mean) | > 1 → overdispersion → negative binomial recommended |
| % zeros in `days_absent_total` (unweighted) | ≈ 70.5% |
| Maximum `days_absent_total` | 63 (observed); 90 = enforced cap |
| Out-of-range values set to NA | 2,448 respondents |

## cchs_analytical — Variable Inventory

### Outcome Variables

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `days_absent_total` | numeric | Primary outcome: row-wise sum of 8 LOP components (NA-safe; all-NA rows → 0) |
| `days_absent_chronic` | numeric | Sensitivity outcome: `lopg040` only (days absent due to own chronic condition) |
| `outcome_all_na` | logical | `TRUE` if all 8 LOP variables were `NA` before summing |

**Source LOP variables (retained raw for transparency):**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lopg040` | Days absent — own chronic condition |
| `lopg070` | Days absent — injury |
| `lopg082` | Days absent — cold |
| `lopg083` | Days absent — flu / influenza |
| `lopg084` | Days absent — stomach flu (gastroenteritis) |
| `lopg085` | Days absent — respiratory infection |
| `lopg086` | Days absent — other infectious disease |
| `lopg100` | Days absent — other physical / mental health reason |

Valid range: 0–90 days. Values outside this range are set to `NA` with a warning.

## sample_flow — Exclusion Audit Table

Records the step-by-step effect of §3.1 inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Always 5 rows (6 if `apply_completeness_exclusion = TRUE`).

**Actual values from 2026-03-20 run:**

| Step | Description | n_remaining | n_excluded | pct_remaining |
|------|-------------|------------:|-----------:|--------------:|
| `1_start` | Starting pool (both CCHS cycles pooled) | 126,431 | 0 | 100.0% |

## Missing Value Handling

Special CCHS response codes recoded to `NA` throughout all factor variables:

| Codes | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 6, 7, 8, 9 | Not applicable / Don't know / Refusal / Not stated (single-digit) |
| 96, 97, 98, 99 | Same meanings (two-digit) |

Original SPSS value labels are stripped during Ferry import (`haven::zap_labels()`).
Numeric raw values are available only in the ferry staging database (`cchs-1.sqlite`).

---

## Variable Harmonization (Cross-Cycle Aliases)

Some variables changed names between the 2010–2011 and 2013–2014 PUMF files.
Ellis maps known aliases to canonical names before white-listing:

| Canonical name | Aliases tried | Affected cycles |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| `edudh04` | `edudr04` | Both cycles |
| `sdcdgcb` | `sdcgcgt` | Both cycles |
| `geodgprv` | `geogprv` | Both cycles |
| `hcu_1aa` | `hcu_1a`, `hcudgmd` | Both cycles |
| `lbfdghp` | `lbsg31` | Both cycles |
| `lbfdgft` | `lbsdpft` | Both cycles |
| `incdghh` | `incghh` | Both cycles |
| `fvcdgtot` | `fvcgtot` | Both cycles |
| `dhhdghsz` | `dhhghsz` | Both cycles |
| `gen_02a` | `gen_02b` | Both cycles |
| `inj_01` | `injdgyrs` | Both cycles |

If a variable is still not found after alias resolution, it is dropped with a warning (INFERRED tier).

## Notes and Limitations

- **4 INFERRED variables absent from both CCHS PUMF cycles** (as of 2026-05-15 run):
  `ccc_300`, `ccc_185`, `dhhdfc12p`, `sdcdgstud`. Of these, `sdcdgstud` is added as an
  NA column so the factor recode block does not error; its output column (`student_status`)
  is all-NA. `dhhdfc12p` is also added as NA (no PUMF equivalent found). The two CCC
  conditions (`ccc_300` — other mental illness; `ccc_185` — digestive disease) are entirely
  absent from the dataset (suppressed in PUMF for confidentiality).
- **Bootstrap weights absent**: No `bsw*` columns found in either CCHS PUMF cycle.
  Bootstrap weights are required for correct variance estimation with the survey package.
  They are distributed as a separate supplemental file by Statistics Canada and were not
  bundled with the PUMF `.sav` files in this project.
- **LOP module availability**: Not all provinces/territories include the LOP module in all cycles.
  Verify `geodpmf × cycle` cross-tabulation for geographic gaps before provincial models.
- **DHHGAGE boundary**: Age code 15 covers 75–79 years; the dataset cannot distinguish exactly
  age 75 from 76–79 within this category (PUMF regrouping).
- **Education cross-cycle label discrepancy**: `EDUDH04` / `EDUDR04` code 3 is labelled
  "Other post-secondary" in 2010 and "Some post-secondary" in 2014. The recode adopts
  "Some post-secondary" as the common label. See `cchs_value_label_diffs.csv`.
- **LBSGSOC cross-cycle label discrepancy**: The 5-category occupation variable uses
  descriptive labels in 2010 (e.g. "MANAG./ART, EDUC") and generic labels in 2014
  ("GROUP 1" – "GROUP 5"). Numeric codes 1–5 are consistent across cycles.
- **CCC conditions**: 2 of 19 requested conditions (`ccc_300` — other mental illness;
  `ccc_185` — digestive disease) are suppressed in the PUMF for confidentiality.
  Thesis Appendix 3 may specify acceptable substitutes.
